            <p>The Story of Black Hair & Braiding

                Black hair has always been more than just hair—it's a symbol of identity, history, and culture. 
                For over <strong>5,000 years</strong>, braids have told stories, signified tribes, and reflected social status across Africa.
                
                During slavery, when cultural expression was stripped away, braiding became an act of resistance—sometimes even used to map escape routes. 
                Despite years of discrimination, movements like <strong>Black Power</strong> and <strong>Natural Hair Movements</strong> reclaimed natural styles as symbols of pride and beauty.
                
                Today, Black hair remains a statement of heritage, creativity, and strength. 
                Laws like The CROWN Act are fighting for the right to wear natural styles without discrimination. 
                Braiding isn't just a trend—it's a tradition that connects generations and keeps Black culture alive.
